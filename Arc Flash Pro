## 🧩 Key Features

### ✅ Incident Energy & Arc Flash Boundary Calculator
- Based on IEEE 1584-2018 formulas
- Supports both low and medium voltage systems
- Distance-to-worker customization for accurate boundary setting
- Real-time warning label preview
- **Built-in Incident Energy Calculator:**
  ```python
  def calculate_incident_energy(Ibf, t, D, Cf=1.0):
      """
      Estimate incident energy in cal/cm^2

      Parameters:
      Ibf (float): Bolted fault current (kA)
      t (float): Arcing time (seconds)
      D (float): Working distance (mm)
      Cf (float): Configuration factor (defaults to 1.0 for box-type equipment)

      Returns:
      float: Incident energy in cal/cm^2
      """
      return Cf * 0.0051 * Ibf**2 * t / (D / 10)**2
  ```

### 📊 Risk Analysis Dashboard
- Shock and arc flash hazard classification by task
- Dynamic risk scoring matrix (based on NFPA 70E Annex F)
- Mitigation tracking and control recommendations

### 🔧 Equipment Database
- Upload or import gear specs from Excel or CSV
- Supports panels, MCCs, disconnects, transformers, and more
- Assign maintenance statuses and PPE categories

### 🖨️ Label Generator
- Prints ANSI Z535-compliant arc flash warning labels
- QR-code ready for field verification
- Customizable company logos and hazard language

### 📋 Compliance Toolkit
- NFPA 70E job briefing and energized work permit forms
- Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) integration
- Auto-generated maintenance inspection sheets (NFPA 70B-compliant)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repo
https://github.com/ianAvogel/ArcFlashPro.git

# Run the prototype
cd ArcFlashPro
python app.py
```

> Requires Python 3.9+. Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## 🛠 Use Case Examples

#### 1. **New Facility Study**
Perform a full arc flash risk analysis across a new manufacturing site, complete with hazard classification and PPE labeling.

#### 2. **Annual Compliance Audit**
Recalculate incident energy values for previously documented equipment and compare to updated working distances.

#### 3. **Contractor Training Tool**
Use the dashboard and label previews to walk contractors through real-world hazard awareness scenarios.

## 🔥 Bonus: Real Talk from the Field
> "This tool saved me hours in reporting and label printing alone. It’s like SKM... if SKM weren’t allergic to UX."

> “Love that I can actually explain the numbers to a client and not sound like a robot.”

> “Finally, a tool that doesn’t make me hate my job. You’re a legend, Ian.”
